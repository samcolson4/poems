## About
This website is designed to mirror the structure of the poems in ['Just Us'](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/319/319488/just-us/9780241467107.html) by Claudia Rankine. 

Instead of using carefully chosen words, this website grabs a select of random words from  JSON file containing the English dictionary (and then some) and puts them into a structure resembling a poem. It often returns nonsense, but sometimes there is an interesting phrase or two there.

The JSON file was downloaded from this [Github repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) and is copyrighted to infochimps.com.
